Mounting note for the HAG housing frame

===================== 
To build the frame I've use ABS more flexible and a good meccanical resistance than PLA, but finally all material are good. 
The model is slice at 0,15mm a good balnce between definistion and strenght.
For the column mounting have to add a threaded bar , 2 washer  and 2 spacer of 10mm all in M3 size. The upper column use e thread bar of 110mm and the lowe 158 mm, to asembly use threadlocker.
